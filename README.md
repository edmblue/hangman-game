### ðŸ“‘ End note 

This was AMAZING, and harder that what I thought, using TypeScript is not easy as a beginner buuttt I love learning it, it helped me a lot to debug my code while writing it but it also gave me a few headache haha. I also try customizing my CSS with some cute colors, I'm really happy with the result
